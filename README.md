- Company: Dedale AI, Corp
- Website: https://dedale.dev
- Location: on-site Paris or on-site San Francisco (or remote in rare cases)
- Generous compensation depending on location
- Generous equity package
- Stack: Rust, Typescript, React, (C++, Svelte, Vue, Python appreciated)
- Skills: Algorithms, Backend, Frontend, LLMs
- Benefits: Generous insurance, public transport stipend, meal stipend & gym stipends (all depending on location)

## About you

Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience or junior with exceptional abilities:
- Impressive will to learn and build
- Impressive & versatile tech skills
- Ability to ship fast & let your ego aside
- Motivated by joining a early-stage startup adventure
- Great English fluency (French does not matter)

## What you will do & learn

You will be deeply involved in inventing the first robust AI augmented debugging tool. Depending on your technical interests, you will own major technical parts of the stack, for example:
- CLI utilities in rust that use AI agents & classic algorithms to explore large codebases
- fast backend systems in rust that can store & search massive graphs of debugging data
- beautiful React based VsCode extensions that help developpers explore code as if it was a game
- specialized LLMs able to run on laptops that you'll train to extract useful information from code

Furthermore, you will join at a early, critical & exciting period in the startup life (that we call "pre-PMF", where we raise money, hire first employees, secure first customers), that will teach you a ton about how launching a nascent startup works, and how to ship fast.

We only want technical people with the most potential to learn and grow with us.

A fixed AI full-stack software project will be agreed upon with you before the beginning. Your typical days will be 1/2 hour 1:1 mentoring with our CTO, 2 hours autonomous learning, 4 hours working on your project & report.

If working from Paris or remote we will help you relocate to San Francisco.

## Our mission

We thrive to make software & AI tools that make developers and other code-adjacent roles (PMs, researchers, security auditors...) way more efficient at understanding code.
Code understanding tasks (review, troubleshooting, onboarding) are 75% of the time spent by pro developers. We see a future in 2 to 5 years were most code will be AI generated and developers' role will fully shift to theses code understanding tasks. We also see a future where the only way for humans to not be enslaved by AI is via their ability to still decipher and understand what AI does, which will probably require understanding a lot of code.

## Story
 
We founded the company in early January this year. We raised a pre-seed investment from Entrepreneur First, one of the best incubator and investor in the international startup scene. We have already released a first version of our product, and in the following months we aim to onboard paid customers, raise a seed round and prepare to relocate to San Francisco.

## How to Apply

Send us by [email](mailto:an.nougaret@gmail.com):
- Minimal Resume (can be just a .txt file) with preferably: what projects you worked on, what tech jobs you had, what education you have
- Your GitHub account
- Describe within less than 10 sentences what is the one most impressive thing (technically) that you have done in your life.

## Application process

1. Immediate Positive or Negative answer
2. If positive, short call with our CTO, Anicet (tech & non-tech questions, no coding required)
3. Short take home assignment
4. Call again with Anicet to discuss your assignment
5. Short call with our CEO, Isaline
6. Meet us on site in Paris or San Francisco if possible
7. Feedback whether fail or success
8. Offer hopefully :)
